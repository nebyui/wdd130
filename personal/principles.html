            <h2>Anatomy</h2>
            <p>
                When drawing people or animals (or plants too!), it is key to understand the 
                anatomical structers of said people or animals. It will help with creating the 
                right shapes and preportions of the body, making them appear more realistic. 
                Primarily focus on the muscle and skeletal systems, as those directly correlate 
                to the preportions and shapes of the parts of the body.

            <h2>Perspective</h2>
            <p>
                Perspective is how objects appear to the viewer or "camera" of a piece to 
                give the impression their size, position, and depth relative to each other. 
                This is important to making objects appear 3D on a 2D medium. For example, 
                objects further away appearing smaller to the viewer is one aspect of 
                perspective.

            <h2>Form</h2>
            <p>
                Form is the shape and occupied space of an object, 
                both in the 3D enviorment and the 2D image.

            <h2>Lighting</h2>
            <p>
                Understanding how light works is key to making images look 
                realistic and adds depth to a 2D image. All light comes from a 
                light source, and the position the light source in the space affects 
                where the highlights and shadows appear on a object.

            <h2>Color Theory</h2>
            <p>
                Colors choice is important for creating realism, effects, 
                or setting a tone to the piece. Color has three components: 
                <br>
                <br>Hue: The shade of visible color (red, blue, green, yellow, purple, etc, 
                and all shades in between) 
                
                <br>Saturation: The intensity of the color. 
                High saturation makes the color more bright and vibrant, whereas low 
                saturation looks greyish and dull. 

                <br>Value: How light or dark the color is. 
                In other words, it is how close the color is to 
                pure white or pure black.

            <h2>Composition</h2>
            <p>
                Composition is the way all of the principles and elements are combined and organized in the completed image.
                Thinking about composition means thinking about where the viewer's eye is guided, the balance and harmony of the different elements,
                how to convey the the message or intent of the piece, etc. Composition has its own set of principles.

                <p>The visual balance of the piece. This is how the components are distributed in the piece. There are different kinds of balance, such as symmetrical and asymmetrical.</p>

                <p>
                    The visual movement or flow of the piece. This can lead the viewers eye or add a sense of motion.

                    Establishing the focal point or making certain components stand out against others. Contrast, scale, and placement within the image is important with this and helps with communicating the main message of the piece.

                    The level of variation in colors, values. and textures. Contrast helps with making components stand out or to help convey the meaning of the piece.

                    Maintaining the proper sizes and proportions of the objects in the piece. Perspective plays a significant role in this and it is good to make sure the preportions appear accurate.
