            <h2>Anatomy</h2>
            <p>
                When drawing people or animals (or plants too!), it is key to understand the 
                anatomical structers of said people or animals. It will help with creating the 
                right shapes and preportions of the body, making them appear more realistic. 
                Primarily focus on the muscle and skeletal systems, as those directly correlate 
                to the preportions and shapes of the parts of the body.

            <h2>Perspective</h2>
            <p>
                Perspective is how objects appear to the viewer or "camera" of a piece to 
                give the impression their size, position, and depth relative to each other. 
                This is important to making objects appear 3D on a 2D medium. For example, 
                objects further away appearing smaller to the viewer is one aspect of 
                perspective.

            <h2>Form</h2>
            <p>
                Form is the shape and occupied space of an object, 
                both in the 3D enviorment and the 2D image.

            <h2>Lighting</h2>
            <p>
                Understanding how light works is key to making images look 
                realistic and adds depth to a 2D image. All light comes from a 
                light source, and the position the light source in the space affects 
                where the highlights and shadows appear on a object.

            <h2>Color Theory</h2>
            <p>
                Colors choice is important for creating realism, effects, 
                or setting a tone to the piece. Color has three components: 
            </p>
            <p>
                Hue: The shade of visible color (red, blue, green, yellow, purple, etc, 
                and all shades in between) 
            </p>
            <p>
                Saturation: The intensity of the color. 
                High saturation makes the color more bright and vibrant, whereas low 
                saturation looks greyish and dull. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Value: How light or dark the color is. 
                In other words, it is how close the color is to 
                pure white or pure black.
            </p>

            <img class="section-img" src="images/composition.jpg" alt="Image for Composition">
            <h2>Composition</h2>
            <p>
                Value is the use and contrast of light and dark color in the piece. 
                Value is used to give depth of form to an image, or add to the overall 
                value of the image. Values can gradually fade into one another, or have 
                a sharp edge where two different values meet. Both have different applications 
                and can add to the style of your piece.
