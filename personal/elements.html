        <p>The elements of art are the stylistic aspects and the "tools" that make up the art piece.</p>
        
        <section class="element-section">
            <h2>Lines</h2>
            <p>Lines are the marks and strokes that form objects in a piece. 
                They can be curved, straight, thick, thin, non-existent, etc. 
                What you decide for the linework is key to definin the style of 
                the piece.

            <h2>Shape</h2>
            <p>
                All art pieces can be simplified into basic shapes: circles, triangles, 
                and squares, Most art projects start with drawing the simple shapes that 
                make up the objects. It helps with mapping out the space it takes in the 
                image and constructing the foundation of the art.

            <h2>Color</h2>
            <p>
                This one is self explainatory. Color is the colors that make up the piece. 
                The way color is used in a composition is called Color Theory (see Principles)

            <h2>Form</h2>
            <p>
                Form is the 3D simplified shapes: triangular prisms, cubes, and 
                spheres when discussing 3D objects. Similar to shape, thinking 
                about the 3D shapes of the objects wil help with mapping out 
                your composition.

            <h2>Space</h2>
            <p>
                Space refers to the 2D area that objects take up on the art piece. 
                There are two types of space, positive and negative. Positive space 
                is the space the object itself fills. Negative space is the areas surrounding 
                or not filled by an object.

            <h2>Texture</h2>
            <p>
                Texture is the visual "feeling" of an object. Whether smooth, rough, soft, 
                it is helpful to learn how to replicate the appearance of the texture of 
                objects. Texture also helps with defining the style of the art.

        <section class="element-section">
            <h2>Value</h2>
            <p>
                Value is the use and contrast of light and dark color in the piece. 
                Value is used to give depth of form to an image, or add to the overall 
                value of the image. Values can gradually fade into one another, or have 
                a sharp edge where two different values meet. Both have different applications 
                and can add to the style of your piece.
