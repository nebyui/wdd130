        Welcome to Art Building Blocks, a useful reference to help artists learn and serve as a reference for the fundamentals of art.
        Although each concept may seem simple and elementary, having a mastery of each one is imperative to making masterful art in any medium.
        All artwork is made using these artistic "building blocks", and master artists simply have great understanding and skill with them, allowing them
        to create whatever they imagine.
        Wherever you are on your journey as an artist, be sure to remember these fundamentals.
        The fundamentals of art can be split into two categories: Principles and Elements.

      <h3>Principles</h3>
      <p>
        The principles of art are "rules" that each component or object that makes up an art piece  follow. 
        These components are anatomy, perspective, form, lighting, color, and composition. </p>
        
        <p>Anatomy: When drawing people or animals (or plants too!), it is key to understand the anatomical structers of said people or animals.
        It will help with creating the right shapes and preportions of the body, making them appear more realistic.
        Primarily focus on the muscle and skeletal systems, as those directly correlate to the preportions and shapes of the parts of the body.</p>
        
        <p>Perspective: Perspective is how objects appear to the viewer or "camera" of a piece to give the impression their size, position, and depth relative to each other.
        This is important to making objects appear 3D on a 2D medium. 
        For example, objects further away appearing smaller to the viewer is one aspect of perspective.</p>
        
        <p>Form: Form is the shape and occupied space of an object, both in the 3D enviorment and the 2D image.</p>
        
        <p>Lighting: Understanding how light works is key to making images look realistic and adds depth to a 2D image.
        All light comes from a light source, and the position the light source in the space affects where the highlights and shadows appear on a object.</p>
        
        <p>Color: Colors choice is important for creating realism, effects, or setting a tone to the piece. Color has three components: 
        Hue: The shade of visible color (red, blue, green, yellow, purple, etc, and all shades in between)
        Saturation: The intensity of the color. High saturation makes the color more bright and vibrant, whereas low saturation looks greyish and dull.
        Value: How light or dark the color is. In other words, it is how close the color is to pure white or pure black.</p>
        
        <p>Composition: The overall arangment of the objects and elements of a piece. This is where you think about what the main subject of focal point of the 
        piece is, the enviorment, and overall "flow" or "direction" of a piece. </p>

      <h3>Elements</h3>
      <p>
        The elements of art are the stylistic aspects and the "tools" that make up the art piece.</p>
        
        <p>Line: Lines are the marks and strokes that form objects in a piece. They can be curved, straight, thick, thin, non-existent, etc. 
          What you decide for the linework is key to definin the style of the piece.  </p>
        
        <p>Shape:All art pieces can be simplified into basic shapes: circles, triangles, and squares, 
        Most art projects start with drawing the simple shapes that make up the objects. 
        It helps with mapping out the space it takes in the image and constructing the foundation of the art.</p>
        
        <p>Form again: Form is the 3D simplified shapes: triangular prisms, cubes, and spheres when discussing 3D objects. 
        Similar to shape, thinking about the 3D shapes of the objects wil help with mapping out your composition. 
        </p>
        <p>Space: Space refers to the 2D area that objects take up on the art piece. There are two types of space, positive and negative.
        Positive space is the space the object itself fills.
        Negative space is the areas surrounding or not filled by an object.</p> 
        
        <p>Texture: Texture is the visual "feeling" of an object. Whether smooth, rough, soft, it is helpful to learn how to replicate 
        the appearance of the texture of objects. Texture also helps with defining the style of the art.</p> 
        
        <p>Value: Value is the use and contrast of light and dark color in the piece. Value is used to give depth of form to an image, 
          or add to the overall value of the image. Values can gradually fade into one another, or have a sharp edge where two different values meet. 
          Both have different applications and can add to the style of your piece. .</p>
